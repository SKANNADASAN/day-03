Screen: The window object represents a window/tab containing a DOM document where as document object is
property of window object that points to the DOM document loaded in that window. We can access a 
document object either using window.
The screen object, implementing the Screen interface, is a special object for inspecting properties of 
the screen on which the current window is being rendered.
*The screen object refers to the actual monitor window or desktop size. 
Note that if you have a multi-mon setup then you will have multiple screen objects. 
A window object belongs to a single screen , though not very window belongs to the same screen

Window:A global variable, window , representing the window in which the script is running, is 
exposed to JavaScript code. The Window interface is home to a variety of functions, namespaces, 
objects, and constructors which are not necessarily directly associated with the concept of a user 
interface window
